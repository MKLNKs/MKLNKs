# Hi guys üëãüèª My name is Serhii Mykolaienko
I am a beginner FrontEnd developer who is looking for a permanent job in a company whose goals are to create value for its clients, and possibly, even to change the world with its product. 

I'm a switcher from my own small business, and I had the opportunity to develop several websites for myself using Tilda and one website using HTML/CSS/JS. 
Whenever I worked on these projects, I always enjoyed the process and the result. That's why I want to work in Tech and become a FrontEnd developer.

I have an understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, and I continue to learn. I'm going to learn TypeScript and FrontEnd testing.

## My stack:
    JavaScript / ES6+ / HTML5 / CSS3 / SCSS / GIT / BEM methodology

## Utility:
    –ü–∏—à—É —Ç–∞ –æ–±–æ–∂–Ω—é—é WebStorm / Tilda / Discord / Trello / CorelDraw / Photoshop / Miro
